export const calanderProjectDescription = `
	A calendar application with good note taking capabilities - essentially Outlook plus Sticky Notes.
	
	No calendar that I've tried - Outlook or Google - matches the above description. Google's has no infinite scroll and Outlook looks a bit old - and, neither have good ability to store notes.
`;

export const guntherProjectDescription = `
	Coded in Swift for the iOS platform. 
	
	In it's current form, the project is a pixelated drawing editor with ability of saving users' artworks to a remote server.
	
	I think it would be neat to improve the code and make it into a re-usable library.
`;

export const racingOddsProjectDescription = `
	A containerized application for scraping and aggregating racing data.
	
	The cool thing about this web scraper is that it functions continuously and in real time.
	
	Meaning, it can run indefinitely - determining what to scrape on its own.

	Generalizing the project to all sports is something intended in the future.
`;

export const psBallProjectDescription = `
	A game in C++ using SDL and Box2D. The intent is to essentially make a 2D-like version of Rocket-League.
	
	This project is nowhere near finished - and, it probably requires a lot more knowledge and effort than I could predict.
	Regardless, the aim is to get more comfortable with 'lower-level' languages.
`;

export const nextProjectDescription = `
	I don't know : |, perhaps something involving hardware (or maybe I'll give ML another crack).
	
	Or maybe a project requiring both hardware/ML.
`;
